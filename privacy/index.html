        <h1>Privacy Policy for Lydrix</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: 7/24/2024</p>
        <p>[Lydrix] ("we," "us," or "our") respects the privacy of its users ("user," "you," or "your") and is committed to protecting the personal information that you may provide while using our wallpaper app. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we may collect from you and how we will use, disclose, and safeguard that information. By using our app, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>(a) Personal Information:</h3>
        <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. We don't require you to register or log in to use our app, so you can download wallpapers without providing any personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>(b) Non-Personal Information:</h3>
        <p>While using the app, we may collect non-personal information such as device information (e.g., device model, operating system version, unique device identifier), app usage data, and anonymous analytics data to improve the app's functionality and user experience. This information is collected in an aggregated and anonymous form and cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>
        
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <h3>(a) Personal Information:</h3>
        <p>Since we don't collect personal information, we do not use it for any purpose.</p>
        
        <h3>(b) Non-Personal Information:</h3>
        <p>The non-personal information we collect is used to analyze app usage patterns, troubleshoot issues, and enhance the app's performance. We may also use this data to improve our marketing efforts and understand user preferences better.</p>
        
        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share any personal information because we don't collect it. Non-personal information may be shared with third-party service providers to help us analyze app usage, but it will be in an aggregated and anonymous form.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>Our app may contain links to third-party websites or services, such as advertisements or external websites.

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take appropriate steps to remove that information from our records.</p>
        
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the non-personal information collected through our app. However, no method of data transmission or storage is entirely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

By continuing to use our app after any changes to this Privacy Policy, you agree to the updated terms.</p>
