        <p>All rights, including trademarks, copyright, and database rights, associated with the app, remain the property of Lydrix.</p>

        <h2>Commitment to Excellence</h2>

        <p>At Lydrix, we are dedicated to providing you with the most useful and efficient app experience possible. In pursuit of this goal, we retain the right to implement changes to the app or introduce charges for its services, at our discretion and for valid reasons. Rest assured, we will always communicate any charges for the app or its services with absolute transparency, ensuring you understand exactly what you're paying for.</p>

        <h2>Data Handling and Security</h2>

        <p>The Lydrix app stores and processes personal data that you provide to us in order to deliver our services. Ensuring the security of your phone and access to the app is your responsibility. To this end, we strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions set by the official operating system of your device. Doing so may expose your phone to potential malware, viruses, and malicious programs, potentially compromising its security features and impacting the functionality of the Lydrix app.</p>

        <h2>Limitations of Responsibility</h2>

        <p>It's important to note that there are certain circumstances for which Lydrix cannot assume responsibility. Some features of the app necessitate an active internet connection. This connection can be established via Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. However, Lydrix cannot be held accountable if the app does not operate at its full functionality due to a lack of Wi-Fi access or if you've exhausted your data allowance.</p>

        <h2>Mobile Network Usage</h2>

        <p>When using the app without Wi-Fi access, please be mindful that your agreement with your mobile network provider remains in effect. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage while accessing the app, as well as any third-party charges. By using the app, you accept responsibility for such charges, including any incurred during international use without disabling data roaming in your home territory (region or country). If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please ensure you have obtained permission from the bill payer for its use.</p>

        <h2>User Responsibility</h2>

        <p>Similarly, Lydrix cannot always assume responsibility for how you utilize the app. It's crucial that you ensure your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you're unable to power it on to access the service, Lydrix cannot be held accountable.</p>

        <h2>Lydrix's Responsibility and Third-Party Information</h2>

        <p>In terms of Lydrix's responsibility for your use of the app, it's essential to keep in mind that while we strive to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, we rely on third parties to supply us with the data necessary to provide this service to you. Lydrix cannot be held liable for any direct or indirect loss you may incur from solely relying on this aspect of the app's functionality.</p>

        <h2>App Updates and Termination</h2>

        <p>At some point, we may release updates for the app. Currently, it is available on both Android and iOS platforms. Requirements for these systems (and any potential future extensions) may change, necessitating updates for continued use. Lydrix does not guarantee continuous updates to align with your specific Android or iOS version.</p>

        <p>However, you commit to accepting offered updates to the application. Additionally, we reserve the right to discontinue app provision and may terminate its use at any time without prior notice. Unless otherwise stated, upon termination:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will cease.</li>
            <li>You must discontinue app usage and, if necessary, remove it from your device.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>

        <p>We may periodically update our Terms and Conditions. It is recommended that you revisit this page regularly for any revisions. Any changes will be communicated by posting the updated Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>

        <p><em>Effective Date of these Terms and Conditions: 2026-12-07</em></p>
